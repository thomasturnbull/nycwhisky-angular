Wait...when it comes to Scotch, most of the whisky produced is either used in blends or consumed right passed its 12th birthday. Let us explore a variety of styles, all at 18 years certainly, and see if this age statement holds up to its fame. In the Industry, some swear by 15, others say 21 is really the peak...we need to know what happens in between. Why is it such a benchmark, and is it even still a valid one in this era of \"NAS\" (no age statement)? How relevant is age after all? Well, just like you can't drive until a certain age, some whiskies can be too green until a certain point. What is the impact of longer maturation, what is the chemistry at work in these cold and damp warehouses of Scotland? What if the barrel had a negative influence on the whisky?

For this class, we'll stick to the 5 \"traditional\" benchmarks: Scotland, Ireland, Japan, Canada and the U.S.A. We each have our take on who should receive the top honors, but when it comes to explaining the reasons of our preferences, it's very often down to preconceived opinions...this is why this class will be conducted \"half-blind\"! You know what will be poured, but not the order in which the whiskies will be poured. What makes a whisk(e)y great anyway? To best answer, we must study the main aspects of its genesis: water, grain, yeast, copper, oak...and the men at work! One could argue that age, or scarcity, make a drink \"the one.\u201d The longer the whisk(e)y matures, the better it \"can\" become...or not! Up until recently, barely any American distiller would venture leaving it in the barrel for more than 12 years. And while the Scots thought this was right then that it became palatable, very few would keep it over 18 years in the cask.

You always hear: \"the blender's art is to create the same expression over and over, by marrying different styles and ages\" and given that your palate also evolves with time, you might not pick up the slight changes in these malts or blends. Was this 12 year old made 20 years ago the same as its modern version? Here, we taste side by side an old expression and the current expression of one brand and mark. At stake is whether you can trust your own judgment: you may have disliked this particular whisky 10 years ago, and you've never given it more attention since...but what if it is NOW to your liking? Four marks will be analyzed in pairs, for a total of 8 Single Malt Scotches. You can do it. Is it for Scotch like it is for cars and dishwashers, i.e. wasn't it better made then? We'll go through some important moments of the Scotch Whisky History while trying to nail down the causes for stylistic changes.","phone":"(212) 226 5545","socialnetworks":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrandyLibrary","website":"http:\/\/brandylibrary.com","city":"New York","street":"25 North Moore St","fulldate":"20150606T150000Z\/20150606T150000Z 00Zm00Z"}},{"event":{"title":"Macallan @ Aries Wine &amp; Spirits","time":"7:00pm","day":"Sunday","month":"Jun","dayofmonth":"7","cost":"$15","free":"This event is not free","location":"Aries Wines &amp; Spirits","rsvp":"www.aries-wineny.com","details":"The Macallan and Aries Wine and Spirits invite you to celebrate this Father\u2019s Day with the world\u2019s most precious whisky at the private single malt tasting and seminar.
