The barrel aging also provides contrast. Located 7,000 feet above sea level in the high desert, this distillery uses a climate-controlled barrel warehouse with temperatures ranging from freezing cold to swelteringly hot and with humidities ranging from bone-dry to sopping wet. These climate changes result in a spirit with spirit, as it were, and with a complexity unrivaled by more temparate distillers.","phone":"(212) 674-7500","socialnetworks":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/astorwines","website":"http:\/\/www.astorwines.com\/","city":"New York","street":"399 Lafayette St","fulldate":"20150929T180000Z 00Z"}},{"event":{"title":"Bourbon Classic @ Brandy Library","time":"6:00pm","day":"Tuesday","month":"Sep","dayofmonth":"29","cost":"$90","free":"This event is not free","image":"http:\/\/nycwhisky.com\/sites\/nycwhisky.com\/files\/events\/mainfloor.190514.jpg.620x465_q85_crop-smart_upscale.jpg","location":"Brandy Library","rsvplink":"https:\/\/gosnazz.com\/event\/2262\/sep-29-2015\/bourbon-classic\/?r=23115","details":"Bourbon Classic\nLet\u2019s face it: you don\u2019t just drink \u201cwhiskey\u201d anymore. Enjoy it straight, on the rocks, maybe a drop of water or poured in a shaker as the strong base for a lip-smacking concoction. When it comes to Bourbon, the quintessential American spirit, you should of course stock your liquor cabinet with a variety: a wheated, a rye-heavy, a young and easy, a barrel-proof, maybe even a single barrel. For sure, Bourbon comes in many shapes and at many rates, making shopping for it more difficult. The Bourbons we enjoy today are the result of a long history, dating back to 1640, and the apotheosis of a craft fine-tuned since WWII. Sour mash, rectification, column and pot stills, rickhouse, mash bill, straight, small batch, Baudoinia, and many more terms will become familiar to you during this class. Who makes it, where and how - you\u2019ll learn that too. You will smell some white dog, witness the breaking down of a barrel, and get to see the actual grains used to make Bourbon.","phone":"(212) 226 5545","socialnetworks":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrandyLibrary","website":"http:\/\/brandylibrary.com","city":"New York","street":"25 North Moore St","fulldate":"20150929T180000Z 00Z"}},{"event":{"title":"Angel&#039;s Envy Bourbon &amp; Rye @ Barley &amp; Grain","time":"6:30pm","day":"Tuesday","month":"Sep","dayofmonth":"29","cost":"$40","free":"This event is not free","location":"Barley &amp; Grain","rsvp":"Call: 646.360.3231 or Email: barleyandgrain@gmail.com","details":"Barley &amp; Grain is kicking off their Fall Whisk(e)y Tastings on September 29th.
