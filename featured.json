The barrel aging also provides contrast. Located 7,000 feet above sea level in the high desert, this distillery uses a climate-controlled barrel warehouse with temperatures ranging from freezing cold to swelteringly hot and with humidities ranging from bone-dry to sopping wet. These climate changes result in a spirit with spirit, as it were, and with a complexity unrivaled by more temparate distillers.","phone":"(212) 674-7500","socialnetworks":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/astorwines","website":"http:\/\/www.astorwines.com\/","city":"New York","street":"399 Lafayette St","fulldate":"20150929T180000Z 00Z"}}]}
