You always hear: \"the blender's art is to create the same expression over and over, by marrying different styles and ages\" and given that your palate also evolves with time, you might not pick up the slight changes in these malts or blends. Was this 12 year old made 20 years ago the same as its modern version? Here, we taste side by side an old expression and the current expression of one brand and mark. At stake is whether you can trust your own judgment: you may have disliked this particular whisky 10 years ago, and you've never given it more attention since...but what if it is NOW to your liking? Four marks will be analyzed in pairs, for a total of 8 Single Malt Scotches. You can do it. Is it for Scotch like it is for cars and dishwashers, i.e. wasn't it better made then?

Much of the flavor in whisky comes from oak, but flavor can also come from the grain, the fermentation, the blend, or the choices made when making the \u201ccuts\u201d (between the heads, hearts and tails of the distillate). As we taste through different examples of flavor, we\u2019ll pinpoint their origins in the production process. We\u2019ll also explore the regional variations that exist as we discover why and how each specific style developed over time.\nMost importantly, you\u2019ll learn your individual style preferences and how to verbalize them so that you can branch out from your go-to brands and truly discover the breadth of deliciousness the whisky world has to offer.","website":"http:\/\/www.astorcenternyc.com","city":"New York","street":"399 Lafayette St.","fulldate":"20150916T183000Z 00Z"}}]}
